# Welcome!

This is the directory for West Shore's Spanish Honor Society Website.
The purpose of this site was to give the club a directory for planning meetings, displaying officers, and exploring relevant information to the club.
As of Februrary 18th, 2023, this site is no longer available thorugh a hosting service. This serves as my first web develpoment project and am looking to implement
changes later to work on JavaScript and UI skills.
